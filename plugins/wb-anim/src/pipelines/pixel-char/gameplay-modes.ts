/**
 * Gameplay mode controls how many directions a sprite sheet must contain
 * and which motion vocabulary drives the prompts.
 *
 *   rpg        — classic 2.5D top-down RPG: 4 directions (down/left/right/up).
 *                Actions retain their native direction sets.
 *
 *   platformer — 2D side-scroller platformer: only RIGHT-facing animations
 *                are generated. The game engine mirrors to the left at runtime.
 *                Jumps, landings, wall interactions and attacks all happen in
 *                a pure side profile, so the prompts emphasise side-view
 *                silhouette readability and gravity-based motion.
